### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am a 2nd year MS in Data Science student at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute(WPI), Massachussets](https://www.wpi.edu/). 
- I am currently being advised by [Prof. Lorenzo De Carli](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~ldecarli/) and [Prof. Fabricio Murai](https://murai.dcc.ufmg.br/) on projects related to Ransomware detection and Money Laundering prevention using the power of AI. 
- Before joining WPI, I was working at [Tata Consultancy Services](https://www.tcs.com/) in India.
- I also did M.Sc in Computer Science from [St. Xavier's College (Kolkata), India](https://www.sxccal.edu/)


Coding has become my hobby too, apart from coding I also enjoy swimming and hitting the gym.
