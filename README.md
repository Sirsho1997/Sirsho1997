I'm a Data Scientist at Indicator Lab, building AI tools for investment strategy and risk management. I specialize in time-series analysis, agentic AI, graph analytics, and deep learning.

I hold an M.S. in Data Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where I focused on graph neural networks for fraud detection. Previously, I worked at Tata Consultancy Services. 
Outside of work, I enjoy playing chess and weightlifting.
